# Math_YoungTableaux

Description:
Write a function mAp3(perm) that given a permutation perm outputs the pairs of Young tableaux in the form of a tuple. Each tableaux should be a list of lists.
            Input: mAp3(Permutation([3,5,2,1,4,6]))
            Output: ([[1,4,6], [2,5], [3]], [[1,2,6], [3,5], [4]])
Note that your function should be able to handle permutations of length 1000.
